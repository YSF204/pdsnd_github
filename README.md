# BikeShare Project

**Date Created:** June 2025

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bikeshare data from major U.S. cities to uncover usage patterns, trip durations, and user demographics. It uses Python and Pandas to perform interactive data analysis based on user input.

## Project Purpose

This project is part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree. The goal is to practice version control with Git and GitHub by managing and refactoring a Python project using proper Git workflows.

## Files Included

- `bikeshare.py` – Main Python script for user-driven data analysis  
- `.gitignore` – Excludes data files from version control  
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation  
- Data files (e.g., `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`) – *Excluded from repo*

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
3. Run the script using:

    ```bash
    python bikeshare.py
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to filter and analyze the data.
